Leebot_Arduino
==============
Languages Used: C, C++
Concepts Used: 
  - encapsulation of functions
  - #ifdef/#endif of different drivers
  - third party library APIs
  - virtualization and inheritance (subclasses)
  - abstraction (device drivers for all motors, etc.)
  - object-oriented programming
  - templates (handles different types of distance sensors)
  - top down design

A self-driving robot using Arduino and C++. Includes motor drivers, ultrasound sensors and various C++ concepts.

This robot was assembled using the following parts:
  1. Arduino Uno Rev3
  2. Arduino Motor Shield
  3. Ultrasound HC-SR04 sensor
  4. BT2TS Slave module (bluetooth sensor)
  5. Magician's driver kit
  6. Breadboard and wires and batteries
  
Most of these can be found on Amazon.

C++ concepts covered included:
  - encapsulation of functions
  - #ifdef/#endif of different drivers
  - third party library APIs
  - virtualization and inheritance (subclasses)
  - abstraction (device drivers for all motors, etc.)
