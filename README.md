# Hackathons and Projects

This repository is a house for all my past projects (e.g. hackathons, student run projects, or past hobbies). The code can be messy and extremely outdated. However, the purpose is to have a log of past code that I found useful in certain tasks. This codebase ranges from 2013 (EWH) to ~2017+ (BCW Hackathon).

# Setup

Setup for each repo is not necessarily tested. But generally I used virtualenv and pip install to get all my repos to work.

# Repos
## 0. Leebot_Arduino
This is a repository for one of my hobbies in building electronics. I used an arduino and some mechanical know-how to construct a self-driving robot that would drive until it found an obstacle. I implemented it using C/C++ on an Arduino board.

## 1. ThermocyclerEWH
This is the repository for my time at UCSD, where I was involved in designing a thermocycler for the purpose of cycling a range of temperatures involved in the PCR process. This would be pretty cost-effective.

Mainly programmed in C/C++ to interact with an Arduino.

## 2. IEEE_Micromouse
This is the repository for my time at UCSD, where I was involved in building a micromouse for the IEEE competition to navigate a maze. The purpose would be to implement a flood-fill algorithm that allows the micromouse to learn the maze.

Mainly programmed in C/C++ to interact with an Arduino / teensyduino.

## 3. HackPrinceton - 2016
This was a hackathon at Princeton in winter 2016, where I worked with a team to analyze a rugby dataset. The dataset was not very clean, but we mainly worked on how to visualize the dataset. 

No prizes won here, but learned a lot about data cleaning and visualization.

## 4. Hophack-2016
This was a hackathon at JHU in spring 2016, where I worked with a team to design a web app for patients to find and interact with clinical trials. We built a web-scraper, django-based web app, and a customized search and ranking system to find optimal clinical trials for a patient.

We won the "Best Medical Hack Challenge" and got a GoPro each.

## 5. HackCambridge - 2017
This was a hackathon at Cambridge University, UK in winter 2018, where I worked with a team to design a deep learning tool for categorizing seizures. We used Microsoft Azure ML, Jupyter, Python with digital signal processing, HPC-GPU training, deep learning with Keras/TFlow.

We were a top-7 finalist, but did not win a prize. Although... we got the best URL name :).

## 6. BCW-2018
This was a hackathon at Bosch Connected World in Berlin in spring 2018, where I worked with a team to try to improve truck eta times using noisy sensor data collected from Bosch devices. We interacted with an Impala database via SQL, designed Python sklearn-pipelines and also cleaned up and visualized the data.

We did not win any prizes, but got to see a lot of cool projects.

## 7. Kaggle BNP Paribas
Kaggle stuff.
