Repository for Thermocycler Sub-Team of Engineering World Health. This is the code that controls the PCR device through an Arduino. The Arduino uses a Polulu Motor Driver to power a Peltier thermoelectric chip to control the PCR reaction. The Arduino also controls the fan (heat sink), checks temperature, controls LED screen display and checks for flags (button pushing). 

The overall purpose of this project is to ship cost-effective units to Mozambique, Africa, for the purpose of providing them access to medical tools they would not be able to afford otherwise. The other parts of the team are: RNA Extraction device, Centrifuge and Gel Electrophoresis.
